# Firestore Schema

## Overview

All collections use the typed collection pattern — see `frontend/src/lib/firebase/firestore.ts`.
Security rules are in `firebase/firestore.rules`.

## Schema versioning

Every document in every collection **must** include a `_schemaVersion` field:

\`\`\`typescript
_schemaVersion: 1 // increment when doing a breaking schema change
\`\`\`

This enables **lazy migration** — when a document is read, check `_schemaVersion` and migrate on the fly if it's behind current.

**Rules:**

- `_schemaVersion` is always `1` on creation
- Non-breaking changes (adding optional fields with defaults) keep the same version
- Breaking changes (rename, remove, type change) increment the version and require a migration function
- Never remove `_schemaVersion` from a schema

## `users` collection

**Path:** `/users/{userId}`
**Access:** Owner-only (user can read/write their own document; admins can read all)

| Field            | Type                | Required | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `uid`            | `string`            | Yes      | Firebase Auth UID (same as document ID)      |
| `email`          | `string`            | Yes      | User's email address                         |
| `displayName`    | `string \| null`    | Yes      | Display name from Auth or profile            |
| `photoURL`       | `string \| null`    | Yes      | Profile photo URL                            |
| `role`           | `'user' \| 'admin'` | Yes      | User role — immutable by user after creation |
| `createdAt`      | `Timestamp`         | Yes      | When the document was created                |
| `updatedAt`      | `Timestamp`         | Yes      | When the document was last updated           |
| `_schemaVersion` | `1`                 | Yes      | Schema version for lazy migration            |

**Creation:** Auto-created by `AuthProvider` on first sign-in via `syncUserProfile()`.
**Deletion:** Hard-delete is disabled in security rules. Use `deletedAt` field for soft-delete.

> **Note:** `AuthProvider`'s `syncUserProfile()` call was part of the previous Firebase
> Authentication flow. TideCloak's frontend auth (current) does not yet create this document —
> reconnecting profile creation to TideCloak identity is part of future backend/RBAC work.
